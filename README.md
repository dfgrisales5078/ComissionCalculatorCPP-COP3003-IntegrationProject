# Monthly Commission Calculator
  
## Programming II integration project:  
  
#### I will develop a console application program. The program will be used to calculate monthly commissions per employee based on how many phones and accessories they sold. This program will be used by the business owners of a retail cellphone franchise to calculate how much they need to pay in commissions to each employee at the end of the month. It will also be used by the employees to keep track of how much money they have earned depending on their sales.
  
#### To develop the program, I will create a Console App written in the C++ programming language.
